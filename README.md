# milli-stress
milli-stress has functions to periodically saturate various physical subsystems
for a short amount of time.

## CPU Stressor
The CPU stressor implements a Sieve of Erathostenes to check if a given number
is prime.

### Running Example
The duration of a CPU saturation generated by this stressor is dependent on the
workload (i.e., the Sieve parameters) and the hardware. Intuitively, a CPU with
higher clock rate should run the algorithm for a certain number `n` faster than
a CPU with lower clock rate, given that other specifications like cache sizes
are the same, thus producing a briefer saturation.

In this running example, we show how to saturate the CPU of a C8220 machine for
a few hundreds of milliseconds. This machine has two 10-core Intel Ivy Bridge
CPUs at 2.20 GHz running Ubuntu 18.04 LTS 64 bits.

The C8220 machine was hosted on CloudLab. An identical environment can be
instantiated using the public CloudLab profile
`Infosphere/C8220-Ubuntu18.04LTS64bit`.

To simplify the analysis, disable all but one virtual core. For the C8220
machine with 40 virtual cores (`cpu0`, `cpu1`, ..., `cpu39`):
```
$ sudo su
# for i in {1..39}; do echo "0" > /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu$i/online; done
# exit
```

Run `lscpu` and check that only `cpu0` is on-line:
```
...
On-line CPU(s) list:  0
Off-line CPU(s) list: 1-39
...
```

For more reproducible results, disable any dynamic overclocking feature like
Intel TurboBoost. For the `intel_pstate` power scaling driver of modern Intel
CPUs:
```
$ sudo su
# echo 1 > /sys/devices/system/cpu/intel_pstate/no_turbo
# exit
```

Also, install the `cpupower` utility and activate the `performance` frequency
governor so the CPU runs at maximum frequency all the time. For Ubuntu 18.04
(Linux 4.0.15):
```
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install linux-tools-common linux-tools-4.15.0-101-generic
$ sudo cpupower frequency-set -g performance
```

Run `cpupower frequency-info` and check that `cpu0` is running at maximum
frequency (2.20 GHz for the C8220 machine):
```
analyzing CPU 0:
  driver: intel_pstate
  CPUs which run at the same hardware frequency: 0
  CPUs which need to have their frequency coordinated by software: 0
  maximum transition latency:  Cannot determine or is not supported.
  hardware limits: 1.20 GHz - 2.20 GHz
  available cpufreq governors: performance powersave
  current policy: frequency should be within 1.20 GHz and 2.20 GHz.
                  The governor "performance" may decide which speed to use
                  within this range.
  current CPU frequency: Unable to call hardware
  current CPU frequency: 2.20 GHz (asserted by call to kernel)
  boost state support:
    Supported: no
    Active: no
    25500 MHz max turbo 4 active cores
    25500 MHz max turbo 3 active cores
    25500 MHz max turbo 2 active cores
    25500 MHz max turbo 1 active cores
```

Install Collectl to monitor the CPU utilization:
```
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install collectl
```

Clone this repository:
```
$ git clone git@github.com:rodrigoalveslima/milli-stress.git
$ cd milli-stress
```

Build the stressors:
```
$ make
```

To check if `n` is prime every `interval` seconds for `duration` seconds or
`count` times:
```
$ ./milli-stress [n] [duration] [interval] [count]
```

If `duration = 0` and `count = 0`, the program runs indefinitely.
